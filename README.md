Credit Card Checker

A javascript project from Codecademy i worked through to practice using loops and arrays. It utilizes a simple Luhn Algorithm to check whether some of the card numbers givenas arrays and as an array of nested arrays (const batch) are valid or not. The two later functions create a new array of invalid card numbers and an array of the names of companies that issuied the invalid card numbers without duplications. 
I think my code is reasonably sound here but any suggestions are welcome. =]
